							<p class="spaced">First and foremost, I love to learn. This is a huge reason I am so excited to be in this field. There is, and always will be, something to learn. </p>
							<p class="spaced" style="margin-left: 40px;">I am an Eagle Scout and I always want to help. I volunteer whenever I have free time. I love to be out in nature just as much as I love a good video game. I particularly enjoy hiking, camping, canoeing, rock-climbing, and just about anything else outside. Also enjoy a good boardgame with friends.</p>
							<p class="spaced" style="margin-left: 60px;">I love to build things. Obviously I love software development, as I am changing fields to follow my passion, but I also love to build just about anything from Woodworking to Legos.</</p>
